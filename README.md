# Visual Onix

Adding graphics to a webpage hasn't always been an easy task. Most of the times programmers have to hire a designer that knows how to work with tools like Adobe Illustrator or Sketch. Others need to dedicate most of their time getting familiar with those softwares, which is something they don't necessarily want or have the time to do. Therefore they might decide to add JPEG or PNG images to the web page, which donâ€™t scale very well and can make the page slower. This is where Scalable Vector Graphics with Visual Onix comes in.

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML based vector format built to simplify 2D graphics creations. These images are written in XML and can be scripted, meaning that animations can be created with them. Visual Onix intends to close the boundaries between coders and graphic designers when it comes to web page development. This tool will serve as a compact development environment for web developers in order to create, design, and animate graphics in websites with easier programming methods. The software will also have a scope of an open-source project. This will make it available for developers to make new libraries and designs, creating an active and supporting community.

With Visual Onix, generating SVG is fast, easy and maintainable. This is achieved by utilizing the concept of object oriented and scripting capabilities from high level imperative and concurrent languages. Visual Onix uses these same concepts, focusing on generating both simple and complex SVG graphics by simply calling methods. Its purpose is to become an easy to learn programming language to save time and headaches for programmers when it comes to adding and customizing graphics in web pages.

## Language Tutorial


## Language Development
Visual Onix is language based on libraries obtained from Python. These libraries are called PLY Lex and PLY Parse. Firstly, from the IDLE Python GUI, the user must run VisualOnixLex.py to call the lexical analyzer created from the library ply.lex. This files allows us to create the tokens and send it to the parser to be executed. When the code it's executed in the IDLE, a terminal window will prompt. Each time a user writes visual onix code the parser changes this code into a Python code, which converts it to an html code with the svg reference.
